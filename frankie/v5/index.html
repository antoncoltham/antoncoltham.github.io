			<p>This website teaches you about Pollution and Recycling!</p>
			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p> Pollution is when the air, water, or land get dirty or unhealthy. This can happen because of rubbish, chemicals, or smoke. Pollution happens when we don't take care of our planet. Pollution can affect humans, plants, and animals. Imagine you had a beautiful playground but people left lots of rubbish or a car drove past and left lots of smoke. This would make the playground not fun and unsafe to play in.</p>
			
			<h3>Water Pollution</h3>
			<p>Water pollution happens when rubbish, chemicals, or dirt get into water making it unsafe for animals, humans, and plant life.</p>
