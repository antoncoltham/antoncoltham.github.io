			<h2>Conservation</h2>
			<p>Conservation is seen as a crucial part of kaitiakitanga (the protection and nurturing of our environment) There are two main types of conservation, resource conservation (preventing wasteful uses of resources) and nature conservation (protecting species from extinction and restoring habitats) 
			Both parts of conservation are crucial parts of kaitiakitanga because they embody the responsibility to protect and restore the natural environment for the future generations.
			Conservation isn’t a simple solution as multiple problems have a major influence over what can or can’t be restored.
			The main problems and what their more known effects are;
				
				Climate change - changing the environment to be warmer in summer and colder in the winter effect species and plants that are not suited or adapted to the newer temperatures 
				
				Pollution (both land and ocean) - lowers the biodiversity and pollutes toxins into different habitats putting species at risk of extinction 
				
				Invasive species - The destruction of habitats and risk of extinction of other species
