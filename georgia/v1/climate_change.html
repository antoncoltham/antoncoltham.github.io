			<h2>Climate Change</h2>
			<p>Climate change is a shift in the Earth's Climate.
			 Mostly driven by human creations like the greenhouse gases made by burning fossil fuels,
			 which trap heat in the atmosphere. This leads to global warming and other effects such as changing rainfall patterns,
			 extreme weather events and rising sea levels. </p>
			<p>how does climate change effect conservation?
			Climate change can change habitats, affect species distribution, and disrupt ecosystems. 
			 For example, rising temperatures are causing the melting of ice, threatening species like polar bears and seals.
			 Changes in rainfall patterns can affect plant growth and water availability, impacting both wildlife and human communities
