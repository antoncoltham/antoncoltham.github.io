			<h3>What are Invasive Species?</h3>
			<p>Invasive species are non-native organisms, plants, animals, fungi, or microorganisms, that are introduced to new environments outside their natural range, either deliberately or accidentally. Unlike native species, invasive species often lack natural predators or other controls in these new habitats, allowing them to establish, spread rapidly, and dominate.
				Once invasive species become established, they can cause significant ecological, economic, and social harm.</p> <p> Ecologically, invasive species compete aggressively with native species for essential resources such as food, water, shelter, and sunlight. This competition can lead to the decline or extinction of native species, resulting in a loss of biodiversity. Invasive species can also alter the physical habitat, for example, by destroying soil stabilising tree plantations, changing soil chemistry, and generally disrupting ecosystem functions and processes.
				Some invasive species introduce new diseases or parasites to which native species have no resistance, further threatening their survival. </p> <p> Others prey directly on native species or even create hybrids with them, diluting native gene pools. The overall impact can transform entire ecosystems, reducing their resilience to other environmental pressures, including climate change.
				Economically, invasive species affect agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and infrastructure. For example, invasive plants can overrun farmland, invasive insects can damage crops or forests, and invasive aquatic species can clog water systems and damage boats. </p> <p> These impacts often lead to costly control efforts and reduced productivity.
				Invasive species are often introduced through global trade, travel, and transportation. Common pathways include ballast water discharge from ships, the pet and ornamental plant trade, accidental transport with goods, and short sighted intentional introductions for agriculture or pest control. </p> <p>
				
				Examples of Invasive Species in New Zealand
				New Zealand has been particularly affected by invasive species due to its isolated ecosystem and unique native species. Some of the most problematic invasive species in New Zealand include:</p> <p>
				Possums (Trichosurus vulpecula): Introduced from Australia for the fur trade, possums have become a major pest by feeding on native plants and bird eggs, damaging forests and threatening native bird species.
				</p> <p>Stoats (Mustela erminea): Introduced to control rabbits, stoats are now one of New Zealandâ€™s worst predators, preying on native birds, reptiles, and insects, many of which evolved without mammalian predators and are highly vulnerable. </p> <p>
				Rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus): Introduced for hunting and farming, rabbits cause extensive damage to native vegetation and farmland through overgrazing. </p> 
				
			<h4>How do Invasive Species affect conservation?</h4>
			<p>Invasive species present one of the greatest challenges to conservation worldwide. By invading new environments where they lack natural predators, invasive species can rapidly establish and spread, causing severe disruptions to native ecosystems. This makes conserving native biodiversity and managing protected areas far more complex and resource-intensive.
				One of the main ways invasive species impact conservation is by outcompeting native plants and animals for resources such as food, water, and habitat. </p> <p> This competition can lead to the decline or extinction of native species, many of which have evolved in isolation and are ill-equipped to cope with aggressive newcomers. For example, invasive predators can decimate native bird populations unused to predation by preying on eggs and chicks, while invasive plants can overgrow native vegetation, reducing habitat availability. </p> <p>
				Invasive species also alter ecosystem functions and processes, such as nutrient cycling, and soil composition. These changes can degrade the quality of habitats and reduce their resilience to environmental stresses, including climate change. For instance, invasive grasses may increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, further threatening native ecosystems.
				Furthermore, invasive species often bring new diseases and parasites that native species have no immunity against, compounding threats to their survival. </p> <p>This creates additional hurdles for conservationists working to protect vulnerable populations.
				The presence of invasive species significantly increases the cost and complexity of conservation management. Controlling or eradicating invasive populations requires continuous monitoring, specialized knowledge, and often expensive interventions such as chemical treatments, biological control agents, or physical removal. These efforts divert limited resources away from other conservation priorities.
				In some cases, invasive species can fragment habitats and create barriers to movement, making it difficult for native species to migrate or disperse which is especially critical in the context of climate change when species need to shift their ranges. </p> <p>
				Finally, invasive species can undermine restoration efforts by re-invading cleared or restored habitats, preventing native species from re-establishing. This means conservation projects must include long-term management plans to address invasive species threats.
				Overall, invasive species complicate conservation by threatening native biodiversity, altering ecosystems, increasing management costs, and challenging the effectiveness of protected areas. Effective conservation must therefore integrate invasive species prevention, early detection, and control as core components.
