			<h3>What is Pollution?</h3>
			<p>
				Pollution is defined as the introduction of harmful substances or forms of energy, such as light, heat, or noise into the natural environment in quantities that are damaging to living organisms and the ecosystem. The word ‘pollution’ originates from the Latin term polluere, which means ‘to contaminate’ or ‘to defile.’ Pollutants can contaminate air, water, and soil, significantly affecting the health of humans, animals, and plants. In simple terms, pollution refers to anything that makes the environment dirty, unhealthy, or unsafe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pollution has serious consequences for health and the environment. For example, air pollution can irritate the eyes, nose, and throat and trigger allergies or asthma. Fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs and even enter the bloodstream, contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Prolonged exposure can lead to more severe conditions like lung cancer, heart attacks, or premature death. Water pollution endangers aquatic life, disrupts food chains, and makes water unsafe for human use. Soil pollution affects crop productivity and can lead to the accumulation of harmful substances in food. On the other hand, natural phenomena such as volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and dust storms also release pollutants like ash, smoke, and chemicals into the air and water.
			</p>
			<p>
				<!-- List of pollution types -->
				There are several types of pollution, including:
				<br>• Air pollution – caused by emissions from factories, vehicles, and burning fossil fuels.
				<br>• Water pollution – from dumping industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals into water bodies.
				<br>• Soil pollution – due to hazardous waste disposal and agrochemicals.
				<br>• Noise pollution – from traffic, machinery, and construction.
				<br>• Light pollution – caused by excessive artificial lighting.
				<br>• Thermal pollution – heat discharge from industries into water bodies harming aquatic life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Beyond human health, pollution also causes ecosystem damage, climate change, and degradation of natural resources. Contaminated environments reduce biodiversity and threaten the survival of various species, including humans. In conclusion, pollution is a pressing global issue that requires immediate attention. Both human and natural activities contribute to it, but it is primarily driven by human negligence and industrialization. Reducing pollution involves responsible waste management, cleaner production technologies, environmental regulations, and public awareness. Protecting the environment is essential for both current and future generations.

			<!-- ---------- Subsection: Impact on Conservation ---------- -->
			<h4>How does Pollution affect conservation?</h4>
			<p>
				Pollution is a major threat to conservation because it degrades natural environments, harms wildlife, and disrupts ecosystem functions that are critical for maintaining biodiversity. The introduction of harmful substances, such as chemicals, plastics, heavy metals, and excess nutrients, into air, water, and soil creates toxic conditions that many species cannot tolerate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Firstly, pollution directly impacts the health of plants and animals. Contaminants like pesticides, industrial chemicals, and heavy metals can poison wildlife, reduce reproductivity, cause diseases, and even lead to mass die-offs. For example, water pollution from agricultural runoff leads to algal blooms that deplete oxygen in aquatic habitats, killing fish and other organisms. Air pollution can cause respiratory problems in animals and reduce the growth and vitality of plants.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, pollution alters habitats and ecosystem processes, making them less suitable for native species. Polluted soils can reduce plant diversity and disrupt nutrient cycling, while contaminated waterways harm aquatic ecosystems and reduce water quality needed for both wildlife and human use. Marine pollution, including plastic waste, affects countless species by entangling animals or being ingested, causing injury or death.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pollution also complicates conservation management. Cleaning up polluted sites is costly, time-consuming, and technically challenging. Conservation efforts must often address both the symptoms and sources of pollution to restore ecosystems effectively. Additionally, pollution can limit the success of restoration projects, as contaminated environments may prevent native species from re-establishing or thriving.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pollution can also interact with other threats like habitat loss, invasive species, and climate change, amplifying their combined impacts. For instance, species weakened by pollution may be less able to cope with habitat fragmentation or competition from invasive species. Because of these effects, reducing pollution is a critical component of effective conservation strategies. Protecting ecosystems from pollutants helps maintain biodiversity, ecosystem services, and the resilience of natural systems.
