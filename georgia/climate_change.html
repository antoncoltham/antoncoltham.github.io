			<h3>What is Climate Change?</h3>
			<p>Climate change refers to significant and long-term changes in the Earth's climate, especially shifts in temperature, weather patterns, and rainfall over decades or longer. While the Earth's climate has varied naturally throughout history through volcanic eruptions and varying solar activity, today’s climate change is occurring at an unusually fast pace and it is generally accepted by the scientific community that this is largely driven by human activities.
				The main cause of modern climate change is the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p> <p> Gases like carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) trap heat from the sun, creating what’s known as the greenhouse effect. While this effect is natural and essential for life on Earth, human actions such as burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, large-scale agriculture and industrial processes, have greatly intensified it. As a result, the Earth’s average temperature is rising at an unprecedented rate.
				This global warming has a wide range of consequences. Among the most visible are melting polar ice caps and glaciers, which contribute to rising sea levels. Warmer oceans also lead to more frequent and intense storms, while heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires have become more common around the world. </p> <p> These changes not only threaten natural ecosystems but also pose serious risks to human health, agriculture, water supply, and infrastructure.
				In response to this crisis, global efforts are focused on two key strategies:
				Mitigation: Taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency, protecting forests, and adopting sustainable practices.
				Adaptation: Preparing for the impacts of climate change by building resilient infrastructure, adjusting agricultural practices, and developing early warning systems for extreme weather. </p> <p>
				International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to unite countries in limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with an ideal target of 1.5°C.
				Climate change is not just an environmental issue, it is a social, economic, and moral challenge that affects every aspect of life on Earth. Efforts to address climate change have had mixed success to this point and it is becoming clear that a concerted effort is required to produce immediate and coordinated action at the individual, community, national, and global levels.

			<h4>How does Climate Change affect conservation?</h4>
			<p>
				Climate change poses significant challenges to conservation by altering ecosystems, species distributions, and natural habitats in ways that complicate traditional protection and management strategies. As global temperatures rise and weather patterns become more unpredictable, conservation efforts must adapt to address these new and evolving threats.</p> <p>
				One of the major impacts of climate change is the shifting of habitats for Earth’s species. Many plants and animals are moving toward higher altitudes or latitudes in search of suitable climates, which means they often leave protected areas that were established based on environmental conditions in the past. This shift can lead to the loss of native species in conservation zones and the introduction of invasive species that disrupt local ecosystems.
				Climate change also causes disruptions in ecosystem functions and biodiversity. For example, warmer ocean temperatures lead to coral bleaching, which devastates reef ecosystems that support countless marine species. </p> <p> Changes in temperature and seasonal timing also cause mismatches between species’ life cycles, such as pollinators such as bees emerging before or after flowers bloom, threatening reproduction and survival. These disruptions weaken ecosystem resilience and increase vulnerability in relation to diseases and habitat fragmentation.
				Additionally, rising sea levels threaten coastal and wetland habitats that are rich in biodiversity. </p> <p> As these areas become inundated, species such as sea turtles, mangroves, and shorebirds lose critical breeding and feeding grounds. Often, there is little room for these habitats to migrate inland, especially in densely populated regions, which can result in permanent habitat loss.
				The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including wildfires, floods, droughts, and storms, further threaten conservation areas. These events can destroy large swaths of habitat and wildlife populations, overwhelm the natural recovery ability of ecosystems, and redirect conservation resources toward emergency responses rather than long-term planning. </p> <p>
				Climate change also creates challenges for conservation planning and management.Traditional conservation models, which assume relatively stable environments, are becoming outdated. It is difficult to predict which areas will remain suitable for species in the future, complicating the designation of protected zones. This has led to a shift toward more dynamic and flexible strategies, such as creating climate corridors to facilitate species movement, implementing assisted migration programs, and adopting adaptive management approaches that can be updated as conditions change. </p> <p>
				Finally, climate change increases pressure on natural resources and local communities, leading to conflicts between human needs and conservation goals. Economic hardships caused by environmental changes can drive increased poaching and illegal land use, further challenging conservation efforts. As a result, effective conservation increasingly requires collaboration with local communities to balance ecological protection with human well-being. </p> <p>
				In summary, climate change complicates conservation by forcing species out of protected areas, damaging ecosystems faster than they can recover, undermining long-term planning, and intensifying competition for resources. Addressing these challenges requires climate-smart, flexible, and science-based conservation strategies that integrate with traditional efforts to protect biodiversity.
