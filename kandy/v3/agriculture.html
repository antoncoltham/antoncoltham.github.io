			<h2>Agriculture.</h2>
			<b>Agriculture:</b>The use of fertilizer on the padocks can cause run offs into our waterways. This causes pollution. </p>
			<h3>Five reasons why agriculture is a problem to rivers</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Water Pollution from Runoff</b>: Agricultural practices often involve the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. When it rains, these chemicals can run off into nearby rivers and streams, leading to water pollution. This contaminates the water, harms aquatic life, and can pose risks to human health.</li><br>
				<li><b>Soil Erosion</b>:Overgrazing, deforestation, and improper tillage practices in agricultural lands can lead to soil erosion. When soil erodes, it can be washed into rivers, increasing sediment levels. This sediment can smother aquatic habitats, disrupt the food chain, and reduce water quality.</li><br>
				<li><b>Nutrient Overload</b>:The excessive use of fertilizers rich in nitrogen and phosphorus can lead to nutrient overload in rivers. This can cause algal blooms, which deplete oxygen levels in the water, creating "dead zones" where fish and other aquatic organisms cannot survive.</li><br>
				<li><b>Water Diversion and Overuse</b>:Irrigation systems used in agriculture often divert large amounts of water from rivers for crop irrigation. This can reduce water flow, leading to the drying up of rivers and affecting the entire ecosystem dependent on that water source.</li><br>
				<li><b>Land Conversion and Habitat Destruction:</b> Agricultural expansion often involves converting wetlands or forests into farming areas, which disrupts natural filtration systems and reduces biodiversity. Wetlands, in particular, act as buffers that filter pollutants before they enter rivers. Their destruction can lead to more pollutants reaching rivers directly.</li>
