			<h2>Human Impact.</h2>
			<p>Keeping livestock out of waterways can prevent damage to riparian vegetation, reduce sediment and nutrient runoff, and protect water quality.</p>
			<p>Five ways humans pollute our rivers </p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Industrial Waste:</b> Factories and industrial facilities often discharge untreated or inadequately treated waste into rivers. This can include toxic chemicals, heavy metals, and other hazardous substances that contaminate water and harm aquatic life. These pollutants can also enter the food chain, affecting both wildlife and humans.</li><br>
				
				<li><b>Agricultural Runoff:</b> As mentioned earlier, the use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides in farming can lead to runoff that carries these chemicals into nearby rivers. This runoff not only contaminates the water but also contributes to nutrient pollution, which can cause harmful algae blooms and disrupt aquatic ecosystems.</li><br>

				<li><b>Plastic and Solid Waste:</b>Improper disposal of plastic and other solid waste contributes to significant river pollution. Plastic items like bottles, bags, and fishing gear often find their way into rivers, where they can take hundreds of years to break down. These items not only litter the water but also pose a risk to aquatic life, which may ingest or become entangled in them.</li><br>
				<li><b>Oil and Chemical Spills:</b>Accidental spills of oil, chemicals, or other hazardous materials can have devastating effects on rivers. These substances can coat the water's surface, depriving aquatic organisms of oxygen, and contaminate drinking water supplies. Even small spills can have long-lasting environmental consequences.</li>
