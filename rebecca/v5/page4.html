      “The Outies,  Outside the Workplace:
The Outie is the individual's true self as they live their life before and after work, on weekends, and during holidays. 
No Memory of Work:
The Outie does not have any knowledge of their time at Lumon Industries or the actions of their "Innie" counterpart. 
Chooses the Procedure:
The Outie is the one who makes the decision to undergo the severance surgery, choosing to separate their work and personal lives. 
Power Over the Innie:
Outies have the power to terminate their "Innie" by quitting their job at Lumon, effectively ending the work persona. 
Perpetual "Weekend":
For a severed employee, the Outie's existence is a continuous "weekend" or personal time, as they are always awake and conscious of their life outside the office. ”
